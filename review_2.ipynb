These meetings are led by your team manager but the department manager is almost always present, too.Although the part of the report that Matt shows you seems fine, you notice that the numerical analysis in another section of the report is missing important conclusions. You can tell that this section of the report does not adhere to the standards of your department's supervisors.Matt seems to be confident about that part of the report and you get the impression that he is not interested in your opinion about it. \"</th>\n",
